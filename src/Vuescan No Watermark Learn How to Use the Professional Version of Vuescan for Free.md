# How to Remove Watermark from Scanned Images Using Vuescan
 
Vuescan is a popular software for scanning images from various scanners. It offers many features and options to enhance the quality and appearance of scanned images. However, if you are using an unlicensed version of Vuescan, you may notice a watermark on your scanned images that says "Vuescan". This watermark can be annoying and distracting, especially if you want to use your scanned images for professional or personal purposes.

Fortunately, there are some ways to remove the watermark from your scanned images using Vuescan. In this article, we will show you two methods to do so. One method involves using a cracked version of Vuescan, and the other method involves entering the registration data manually every time you scan an image. Both methods are for educational purposes only, and we do not encourage or endorse using cracked software or violating the terms and conditions of Vuescan. If you like Vuescan and want to use it without any limitations, we recommend that you buy it from the official website.
 
## Method 1: Using a Cracked Version of Vuescan
 
This method involves downloading and installing a cracked version of Vuescan that has a valid serial number. You can find such versions on various websites or torrent sites, but be careful as they may contain viruses or malware. We are not responsible for any damage or harm caused by using such versions.
 
Here is an example of a cracked version of Vuescan 9.4 that we found on a website[^2^]. You can download it from the link below:

` 
Once you download the zip file, extract it and install the version that is compatible with your system (32 bit or 64 bit). Inside the zip file, there is a folder named "Key", and inside that you can find "key.txt" which contains the serial number. When you first run Vuescan, it will ask you to register the product. Simply enter the email, customer ID and the serial key from the above key.txt file and as soon as you complete typing, it will show as "OK" in all the text boxes. This means your details are valid. Click on OK button and continue scanning.

## Method 2: Entering Registration Data Manually
 
This method involves entering the registration data manually every time you scan an image using Vuescan. This way, you can use any version of Vuescan without downloading or installing anything. However, this method can be tedious and time-consuming, as you have to enter the same data repeatedly.
 
The registration data that you need to enter are the same as in method 1. You can find them in the key.txt file that we mentioned above, or you can watch this video tutorial[^1^] [^3^] that shows how to remove the watermark using Vuescan 9.4:

To enter the registration data manually, follow these steps:
 
1. Scan your image as usual using Vuescan.
2. When you are ready to save, do not click on save button.
3. Instead, click on help menu item, and go to "About..".
4. A popup dialog will appear asking you to enter the serial number.
5. Now enter your data there and save the image.

You should see no watermark on your scanned image.
